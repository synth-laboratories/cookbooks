please explain to me how openai does its code cookbooks and puts them in its docs and then explain how I could add a cookbooks section to my synth-ai docs based on my brand new cookbooks repo that will house the examples from my current synth-laboratories/synth-ai repo notes https://docs.usesynth.ai/task-app https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks https://github.com/synth-laboratories/synth-ai/pulls basically give me guidelines on how to update docs, and moves tuff from synth-ai to cookbooks and then integrate the cookbooks to mitnlfiy docs showing code with links etc to closely emulate the experience people get from openai cookbooks


Here’s a concrete “do this” plan that’s as close as possible to how OpenAI runs its Cookbook, adapted to **synth-ai**, your new **cookbooks** repo, and Mintlify docs.

---

## 1. Mirror the OpenAI Cookbook pattern

OpenAI’s setup is basically:

* **One GitHub repo** that holds all runnable examples + mini guides: `openai/openai-cookbook`. ([GitHub][1])
* **A separate docs frontend** (cookbook.openai.com) that surfaces those examples as nice articles, each with code snippets and a **“view on GitHub”** link to the exact directory/file in the repo. ([OpenAI Cookbook][2])

You already have:

* `synth-laboratories/cookbooks` – currently just LICENSE (blank slate). ([GitHub][3])
* `synth-laboratories/synth-ai` – SDK, plus existing examples and PRs evolving the API. ([GitHub][4])
* Mintlify docs at `docs.usesynth.ai` (e.g., `task-app` page with a standard Mintlify sidebar + code blocks). ([docs.usesynth.ai][5])

Goal:

* **All runnable examples** live in `cookbooks/`.
* **Docs site** shows curated snippets + buttons back to `cookbooks/`.
* `synth-ai` just points to cookbooks instead of embedding big examples.

---

## 2. Shape the `cookbooks` repo

Right now `cookbooks` just has a LICENSE, so you can set the structure however you want. ([GitHub][3])

### 2.1. Create a topic-based folder layout

Something like:

```bash
cookbooks/
  prompt-optimization/
    mipro-basic/
  supervised-fine-tuning/
    chat-sft-basic/
  reinforcement-learning/
    math-rl-qwen/
  task-apps/
    math-single-step/
    polyglot-task-app/
  integrations/
    modal-deploy/
    local-docker/
  baselines-and-evals/
    grade-school-math-baseline/
```

Guidelines:

* **Folder name = topic**, subfolder = example slug.
* Slugs should be URL-safe and match what you’ll use in docs (`math-rl-qwen`, `math-single-step`, etc.).

### 2.2. Standardize each example directory

For every example:

```bash
cookbooks/reinforcement-learning/math-rl-qwen/
  README.md
  main.py
  requirements.txt      # only if needed beyond `synth-ai`
  configs/
    task.yaml           # optional
  assets/               # optional
```

`README.md` template:

````md
# Train Qwen on math with RL

Minimal RL run that improves a math-solving agent using Synth.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip install synth-ai`
- Set any required environment variables (model API keys, DB, etc.)

## Run

```bash
python main.py
````

## Learn more

Full walkthrough in the docs: [https://docs.usesynth.ai/cookbooks/reinforcement-learning/math-rl-qwen](https://docs.usesynth.ai/cookbooks/reinforcement-learning/math-rl-qwen)

````

Guidelines:

- Keep **README short**; deep explanations go in Mintlify.
- Always include:
  - Prereqs  
  - One clear “Run” command  
  - Link back to the docs page  

---

## 3. Move examples from `synth-ai` → `cookbooks`

You’ll do this example-by-example.

### 3.1. For each existing example

1. **Pick a topic + slug**  
   - e.g. `task-apps/math-single-step`, `reinforcement-learning/math-rl-qwen`.

2. **Create the new directory in `cookbooks/`**  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p cookbooks/task-apps/math-single-step
````

3. **Copy code from `synth-ai`**

   * Move the core script(s) / notebook(s) and minimal config into the new directory.
   * Trim any repo-specific cruft that’s only relevant inside `synth-ai` itself.

4. **Write the `README.md`** using the template above.

5. **In `synth-ai`, replace the old example with a pointer**

   * If you had `synth_ai/examples/task_app_math/`, delete the heavy code and drop in:

     ```md
     # Examples moved to Cookbooks

     This example now lives in the Synth Cookbooks repo:

     https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks/tree/main/task-apps/math-single-step
     ```

6. **Update `synth-ai` root README**

   * Add a short “Cookbooks” section:

     ```md
     ## Cookbooks (Examples)

     For runnable examples, see the Synth Cookbooks:

     - 📚 Docs index: https://docs.usesynth.ai/cookbooks
     - 💻 Code: https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks
     ```

7. **Tests that depended on examples**

   * If tests use these scripts as fixtures, either:

     * Keep tiny “test-only” fixtures in `synth-ai/tests/fixtures/`, or
     * Import shared logic from `synth-ai` and keep cookbooks purely as consumers.

---

## 4. Wire Cookbooks into Mintlify

Your docs are Mintlify-based (see the `Powered by Mintlify` footer and the structured sidebar on `/task-app`). ([docs.usesynth.ai][5])

You want:

* A **Cookbooks** group in the sidebar.
* One **MDX page per example**, each linking to the corresponding `cookbooks` directory.
* Cross-links from conceptual docs (Task Apps / RL / Prompt Optimization) into relevant examples.

### 4.1. Add a “Cookbooks” group in `mint.json` / `mintlify.json`

Somewhere in your navigation config:

```json
{
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Guide",
      "pages": ["/overview", "/task-app", "/prompt-optimization/overview"]
    },
    {
      "group": "Cookbooks",
      "pages": [
        {
          "name": "Prompt Optimization",
          "pages": ["/cookbooks/prompt-optimization/mipro-basic"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Supervised Fine-Tuning",
          "pages": ["/cookbooks/sft/chat-sft-basic"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Reinforcement Learning",
          "pages": ["/cookbooks/reinforcement-learning/math-rl-qwen"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Task Apps",
          "pages": ["/cookbooks/task-apps/math-single-step"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Integrations",
          "pages": ["/cookbooks/integrations/modal-deploy"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Adjust paths to your actual file structure.

### 4.2. One MDX page per cookbook example

Create files like:

```bash
docs/cookbooks/task-apps/math-single-step.mdx
docs/cookbooks/reinforcement-learning/math-rl-qwen.mdx
```

Example MDX page:

````md
---
title: Math single-step task app
description: Build and run a minimal task app for single-step math rollouts with Synth.
tags: ["task-apps", "math", "fastapi"]
---

This example shows how to build a simple FastAPI-based task app for math problems, wire it into Synth's training harness, and expose the standard rollout endpoints.

[View full example on GitHub](https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks/tree/main/task-apps/math-single-step){.button}

## Quick start

```bash
pip install synth-ai
export ENVIRONMENT_API_KEY=...
python main.py
````

## Core snippet

```python
from synth_ai.task.server import ProxyConfig, RubricBundle, TaskAppConfig
from synth_ai.task.tracing_utils import build_tracer_factory
from synth_ai.tracing_v3.session_tracer import SessionTracer

from my_math_app import (
    build_dataset,
    _base_task_info,
    describe_taskset,
    provide_task_instances,
    rollout_executor,
    OUTCOME_RUBRIC,
    EVENTS_RUBRIC,
    math_router,
)

def build_config() -> TaskAppConfig:
    registry, dataset = build_dataset()
    base_info = _base_task_info()
    tracer_factory = build_tracer_factory(SessionTracer, enabled=True)

    app_state = {"math_dataset": dataset}
    if tracer_factory:
        app_state["session_tracer_factory"] = tracer_factory

    proxy = ProxyConfig(enable_openai=True, enable_groq=True)
    return TaskAppConfig(
        app_id="math-single-step",
        name="Math Single Step Task",
        base_task_info=base_info,
        describe_taskset=lambda: describe_taskset(dataset),
        provide_task_instances=lambda seeds: provide_task_instances(dataset, seeds),
        rollout=rollout_executor,
        dataset_registry=registry,
        rubrics=RubricBundle(outcome=OUTCOME_RUBRIC, events=EVENTS_RUBRIC),
        proxy=proxy,
        routers=(math_router,),
        app_state=app_state,
    )
```

### 4.3. Cross-link from existing guides (e.g., Task App page)

On a conceptual page like `/task-app`, add a “Cookbooks” section or callout.

For example in `docs/task-app.mdx`:

```md
## Cookbooks

Looking for a full, runnable example?

- [Math single-step task app](/cookbooks/task-apps/math-single-step)
- [Polyglot task app](/cookbooks/task-apps/polyglot-task-app)
```

This mirrors how OpenAI’s conceptual docs link down into specific Cookbook entries. ([OpenAI Cookbook][2])

### 4.4. (Optional) Cookbooks index page with cards

Add a `/cookbooks/index.mdx` (or just `/cookbooks.mdx`) that lists featured examples:

```md
---
title: Cookbooks
description: Runnable examples for Synth.
---

Use these examples as starting points for your own training runs.

::cards
- title: Math single-step task app
  description: Minimal task app for math rollouts.
  href: /cookbooks/task-apps/math-single-step
- title: Train Qwen on math with RL
  description: RL loop over a math reasoning dataset.
  href: /cookbooks/reinforcement-learning/math-rl-qwen
- title: MIPRO prompt optimization
  description: Optimize prompts using Synth's prompt optimization loop.
  href: /cookbooks/prompt-optimization/mipro-basic
::
```

Then link this index from your main navigation or homepage.

---

## 5. Minimal “house rules” to emulate OpenAI’s Cookbook UX

* **One source of truth for examples** = `cookbooks/` repo, not `synth-ai`. ([GitHub][1])
* **Docs pages are thin**: short narrative + 1–2 core snippets + a big **GitHub button**.
* **Every example directory has a README** with:

  * 1‑liner goal
  * prereqs
  * single run command
  * link back to its docs page
* **Every docs page has a link back** to the exact example directory on GitHub.
* **Cross-linking**:

  * Conceptual guide → 1–3 relevant Cookbooks.
  * Cookbooks → related concepts (“See also: Task Apps / RL Overview”).

If you tell me the first specific example you’re migrating (e.g., a particular `task-app` or RL example from `synth-ai`), I can sketch the exact directory contents for `cookbooks/` and the corresponding MDX page text line-for-line.

[5]: https://docs.usesynth.ai/task-app "Prepare Your Code for Training - Synth AI"


Here’s a concrete playbook you can follow.

---

### 1. How OpenAI runs its Cookbook

At a high level, OpenAI separates:

* **Core docs** — API reference & conceptual guides at `platform.openai.com`
* **Cookbook** — a separate “examples & guides” property (`cookbook.openai.com`) backed by its own repo. ([OpenAI Cookbook][1])

Concretely:

1. **Separate repo for examples**

   * `openai/openai-cookbook` is its own repo. ([GitHub][2])
   * It has:

     * `articles/` — narrative guides (Markdown/MDX)
     * `examples/` — runnable scripts / notebooks
     * `images/` — supporting assets
     * `registry.yaml` / `authors.yaml` — metadata for the site (titles, tags, slugs, authors). ([GitHub][2])

2. **Site is generated from the repo**

   * `cookbook.openai.com` is a separate site with topic filters (“Agents, Multimodal, Text, Guardrails, Optimization…”) that are essentially views over that registry. ([OpenAI Cookbook][1])
   * A static-site build step:

     * Reads `registry.yaml`
     * Maps each `articles/*.md` file to a route
     * Uses metadata (tags / topics) for the “Topics”, “Featured”, “Popular” lists.

3. **Docs ↔️ Cookbook relationship**

   * Core docs link **out** to cookbook guides (“See examples in the Cookbook”) for deeper, runnable examples.
   * Cookbook pages link **back** to API docs and reference (“Read the full API docs”).

4. **Patterns inside each cookbook page**

   Typical page structure:

   * Short “What you’ll build” intro
   * Prereqs (API keys, installation)
   * Step-by-step narrative, each step with a **small code block**
   * A “full script / notebook” link: `View full example on GitHub` (under `examples/`).
   * Sometimes multi-language blocks (`python`, `curl`, etc.).

You don’t need to replicate the entire infra (registry, custom site) to mimic the *experience*—you mostly need:

* A dedicated examples repo
* A clean way to surface them in docs with:

  * Topic grouping
  * Step-by-step narratives
  * “View full example” links

---

### 2. Design the `synth-laboratories/cookbooks` repo

Right now your `cookbooks` repo is basically empty (only `LICENSE`). ([GitHub][3])
Your main `synth-ai` repo already has `examples/` and user-facing snippets in the README. ([GitHub][4])

**Goal:** make `cookbooks` the canonical home of runnable examples and demos.

Suggested structure:

```text
cookbooks/
  README.md
  pyproject.toml / requirements.txt   # pinned deps: synth-ai, openai, etc.
  examples/
    task-apps/
      math-single-step/
        task_app.py
        README.md
      crafter-survival/
        task_app.py
        README.md
    prompt-learning/
      banking77-gepa/
        config.toml
        run_prompt_learning.py
        README.md
    rl/
      qwen3-math/
        train_rl.py
        rollout_viz.ipynb
  datasets/          # optional: dataset download helpers or links
  images/            # diagrams used in docs
  registry.yaml      # optional: metadata for future automation
```

**Per-example directory layout:**

```text
examples/<area>/<slug>/
  README.md         # short narrative: what this example shows
  main.py           # or task_app.py, train.py, etc.
  config.toml       # if applicable
  requirements.txt  # optional, if it differs from repo root
```

`README.md` should be short and code-centric; main narrative will live in Mintlify, but the README is nice when browsing GitHub.

---

### 3. Migration plan: from `synth-ai` → `cookbooks`

Your `synth-ai` repo is currently both SDK source + examples (`examples/`, some example snippets in README, etc.). ([GitHub][4])

**Objective:** keep `synth-ai` lean (library + tiny getting-started snippets), and move heavier “how-to” examples into `cookbooks`.

#### Step 1 – Inventory examples

In `synth-ai`:

* Walk `examples/`, `fixtures/`, and any demo-ish scripts under `scripts/` or `synth_ai/` that are user-facing (e.g. demo RL training, task apps, prompt-learning configs). ([GitHub][4])
* Decide which ones are:

  * **Core examples** → move to `cookbooks`
  * **Internal / tests** → keep in `synth-ai` or tests only

Make a simple mapping doc (even in a comment or issue) like:

```text
synth-ai/examples/baseline/banking77_baseline.py
  → cookbooks/examples/prompt-learning/banking77-gepa/main.py

synth-ai/examples/task_apps/math_single_step.py
  → cookbooks/examples/task-apps/math-single-step/task_app.py
```

#### Step 2 – Physically move the code

For each selected example:

1. **Copy** the code into the matching `cookbooks/examples/...` directory.
2. Clean up:

   * Ensure imports use `synth_ai` (installed) instead of relative `..` imports.
   * Parameterize anything that’s currently hard-coded to your environment (paths, API keys).

In `cookbooks`, add a simple top-level `README.md`:

````md
# Synth Cookbooks

Examples demonstrating how to use Synth AI for:

- Task apps (FastAPI wrappers)
- Prompt learning & GEPA / MIPRO
- RL training & baselines

To run an example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks
cd cookbooks/examples/task-apps/math-single-step
uv sync  # or pip install -r requirements.txt
python task_app.py
````

````

#### Step 3 – Leave stubs + links in `synth-ai`

In `synth-ai`, don’t nuke everything—leave pointers.

- In `README.md`, change the “Examples / Baselines” section to something like:

```md
For full runnable examples (task apps, baselines, prompt learning), see the
[Synth Cookbooks](https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks).
````

* In `examples/`:

  * Either:

    * Leave a `README.md` that says “Examples moved to `synth-laboratories/cookbooks`”
    * Or keep only the **most minimal** quickstart example; everything else lives in `cookbooks`.

This mirrors the “SDK repo + cookbook repo” separation OpenAI uses. ([GitHub][2])

---

### 4. Add a “Cookbooks” section to your Mintlify docs

Your docs at `docs.usesynth.ai` are clearly Mintlify-style, with a side-nav that already has “Examples” slots under several sections (Prompt Optimization, SFT, RL). ([Synth AI][5])

You want those “Examples / Cookbooks” nodes to surface content from your `cookbooks` repo.

#### Step 4.1 – Information architecture

Make a top-level “Cookbooks” landing page + per-topic subpages, roughly:

* **Cookbooks**

  * Task Apps

    * Build a math reasoning task app
    * Polyglot task app
  * Prompt Learning

    * Banking77 with GEPA
    * MIPRO quickstart
  * RL

    * Qwen3-0.6B math training
    * Crafter survival task

You can either:

* Create a **dedicated “Cookbooks” section** in the nav, or
* Fill the existing `Examples` items under each main section with these cookbook pages. ([Synth AI][5])

#### Step 4.2 – Mintlify nav config

In your docs repo (whatever backs `docs.usesynth.ai`), you’ll have a `mint.json` or `mint.config.*` file describing navigation.

Conceptually, add something like:

```json
{
  "name": "Cookbooks",
  "pages": [
    { "name": "Overview", "path": "/cookbooks/overview" },
    {
      "name": "Task Apps",
      "pages": [
        { "name": "Math Reasoning Task App", "path": "/cookbooks/task-apps/math-single-step" },
        { "name": "Crafter Survival Task App", "path": "/cookbooks/task-apps/crafter-survival" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Prompt Learning",
      "pages": [
        { "name": "Banking77 with GEPA", "path": "/cookbooks/prompt-learning/banking77-gepa" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

…and/or wire those same pages into the existing `Examples` slots under:

* Prompt Optimization → Examples
* Supervised Fine-Tuning → Examples
* Reinforcement Learning → Examples ([Synth AI][5])

#### Step 4.3 – Structure of a cookbook doc page

Each Mintlify page should be a **narrative wrapper** around one example directory in `cookbooks`.

Example (for `math-single-step` task app):

````md
---
title: "Math Single-Step Task App"
description: "Build and deploy a math reasoning task app using Synth AI."
---

> This example lives in the
> [`cookbooks` repo](https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks/tree/main/examples/task-apps/math-single-step).

## What you’ll build

A FastAPI task app that exposes Synth-compatible routes for single-step math reasoning.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- `uv` or `pip`
- A Synth account and API keys configured

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks
cd cookbooks/examples/task-apps/math-single-step
uv sync  # or pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Key code

```python
from synth_ai.task.server import (
    ProxyConfig,
    RubricBundle,
    TaskAppConfig,
)

from synth_ai.task.tracing_utils import (
    build_tracer_factory,
    resolve_sft_output_dir,
    resolve_tracing_db_url,
    tracing_env_enabled,
)

from synth_ai.tracing_v3.session_tracer import SessionTracer

def build_config() -> TaskAppConfig:
    registry, dataset = build_dataset()
    base_info = _base_task_info()
    tracing_enabled = tracing_env_enabled()
    tracer_factory = build_tracer_factory(
        SessionTracer,
        enabled=tracing_enabled,
        db_url=resolve_tracing_db_url(),
    )
    # ...
```

Then:

* Show **only the critical parts** in-doc (config builder, rollout executor, routes).
* Link to “View full example on GitHub” for the whole file:

```md
[View full example on GitHub](https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks/blob/main/examples/task-apps/math-single-step/task_app.py)
```

This matches what Cookbook pages do: short, focused snippets + full script link. ([OpenAI Cookbook][1])

#### Step 4.4 – Re-use snippets you already have

Your current docs already show substantial code snippets for task app anatomy (`build_config`, endpoint specs, etc.). ([Synth AI][5])

You can:

* Move the **canonical implementation** into `cookbooks/examples/task-apps/math-single-step/task_app.py`.
* Keep the docs snippets, but ensure they exactly match the code in `cookbooks` (copy from the example whenever updating).
* Add a little banner at the top of those pages:

```md
> Full runnable example:
> [Math Single-Step Task App Cookbook](../cookbooks/task-apps/math-single-step)
```

---

### 5. Cross-linking to emulate the OpenAI experience

To really match the OpenAI feel:

1. **Top-level Cookbooks page**

   * Brief explanation of what a “cookbook” is for Synth.
   * Cards or lists grouped by topic (“Task Apps”, “Prompt Learning”, “RL”).

2. **Cross-links from core docs**

   * At the bottom of conceptual pages (like “Prepare Your Code for Training”), add:

     ```md
     ## Related cookbooks

     - [Math Single-Step Task App](../cookbooks/task-apps/math-single-step)
     - [Polyglot Task App](../cookbooks/task-apps/polyglot)
     ```

3. **Cross-links back from cookbooks**

   * At the bottom of each cookbook page, add:

     ```md
     ## Related docs

     - [Prepare Your Code for Training](/task-app)
     - [Train Your Model](/train)
     ```

4. **GitHub links everywhere**

   * Each cookbook page:

     * “View example on GitHub”
     * “Browse all cookbooks” → `https://github.com/synth-laboratories/cookbooks`

5. **Versioning + stability**

   * Pin `synth-ai` version in `cookbooks` (e.g. `synth-ai==0.2.25`) so examples don’t silently break.
   * When you release a major SDK version, run through the cookbooks, update where necessary, and bump the pinned version.

---

### 6. Concrete checklist

If you want a minimal “do this next” list:

1. **In `cookbooks` repo**

   * Add `README.md`, `examples/` scaffold, and `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt`.
   * Move one flagship example from `synth-ai/examples` (e.g. math RL or math task app) into `examples/...`.

2. **In `synth-ai` repo**

   * Replace that example with a pointer to `cookbooks`.
   * Update `README.md` “Examples” section to link to cookbooks.

3. **In docs repo**

   * Add a `Cookbooks` section to nav (`mint.json` / config).
   * Create a `cookbooks/overview` page.
   * Create 1–2 cookbook pages that wrap the moved examples, with:

     * Short intro
     * Setup commands
     * Key code snippets
     * “View full example on GitHub” links.

4. **Iterate**

   * Gradually move every user-facing example from `synth-ai` to `cookbooks`.
   * For each, add a matching Mintlify page and cross-links from relevant conceptual docs.

That gets you very close to the OpenAI Cookbook experience, but with minimal infra and maximum reuse of what you already have.
