# Synth Cookbooks

This repository now hosts the examples previously under `synth-ai/examples/`.

- Everything was copied into `dev/` for now (e.g., `dev/polyglot/`, `dev/task_apps/`, `dev/blog_posts/`). The structure will be polished in follow-up passes.
- Migration plan: see `plan.txt`
- Standards for cookbook READMEs/docs: see `standards.md`
