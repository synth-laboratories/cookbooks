# Synth SDK/CLI Footguns
# Last updated: 2024-11-26

## ✅ FIXED (pending release)

1. [FIXED] synth-ai 0.3.0 from uvx/PyPI is broken (SyntaxError in sdk/api/research_agent/job.py)
   - Fixed in synth-ai nightly branch
   - Needs 0.3.1 release to PyPI

2. [FIXED] Remote task apps + tunnels generate repeated "InsecureRequestWarning" noise
   - Fixed: SDK no longer resolves HTTPS URLs to IPs (breaks SSL SNI)
   - Commit: "fix: don't resolve HTTPS URLs to IP - breaks SSL/TLS SNI"

3. [FIXED] MIPRO/GEPA scripts need explicit overrides for task_app_url
   - InProcessTaskApp now fetches tunnel config dynamically from backend using API key
   - Named tunnels (tunnel_mode="named") work automatically

## ⚠️ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (doc needed)

4. GEPA configs fail if pareto_set_size exceeds train seeds count
   - This is correct validation - pareto_set_size must be <= len(train_seeds)
   - TODO: Add clearer error message and document in SDK docs

5. MIPRO requires per-stage policy configs (stages[].policy with model/provider)
   - Backend requirement since 0.3.0
   - TODO: Document in MIPRO guide with example config

6. SFT CLI rejects variety="qlora" (only fft/lora supported)
   - Expected - qlora is quantized LoRA, not a training variety
   - CLI behavior is correct; user should use variety="lora"

## ❌ OUTSTANDING BUGS (need issues)

7. [BUG] MIPRO "No trace registration found for correlation_id=…" mid-bootstrap
   - Job: pl_2a6f86209a4f407c
   - Happens with Cloudflare tunnels
   - Root cause: Trace pipeline not registering correlation IDs for tunneled jobs
   - ACTION: File backend issue

8. [BUG] SFT dataset upload to agent-learning.onrender.com returns 503
   - Error: file_metadata_write_failed / No route to host to Wasabi
   - Root cause: Render backend can't reach Wasabi S3 (network/firewall issue)
   - ACTION: File infra issue for Wasabi connectivity

## 📝 DOC/CONFIG CLEANUP

9. Cookbooks reference stale paths (examples/rl, localhost task_app_url)
   - TODO: Update RL README with correct paths
   - TODO: Update task_app_url examples to use tunnel URLs or InProcessTaskApp
