# GEPA (Genetic Evolution of Prompt Architectures) Configuration
#
# GEPA uses genetic algorithms to evolve prompt structures:
# - Mutation operators (add/remove/modify prompt sections)
# - Crossover (combine best parts of different prompts)
# - Selection (keep top-performing variants)
#
# Best for:
# - Complex prompt structures
# - Multi-component prompts (system + few-shot + chain-of-thought)
# - Exploring diverse prompt mutations
